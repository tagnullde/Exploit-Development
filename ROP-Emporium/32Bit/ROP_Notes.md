## Usefull commands

ldd <binary> (shows linked libs like libc)

checksec.sh

objdump -M intel -R <binary> (Read GOT Entry)

objdump -M intel -x <binary> (Examine Headers -> Search for Write-Access)

objdump -M intel -d <binary> | grep <function>

objdump -M intel -d <libc_path> | grep _read (searches libc for offset of _read from start of libc)

## Leak address of system()

addr_of_system() = addr_of_read()_in_libc - libc_read()_offset + libc_system()_offset
